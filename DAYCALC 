        Code Modified..
        Code:

        if( (year / 4 == 0) && (year % 400 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) )
        this is wrong..
        correct is:
        if((year%100!=0)&&(year%4==0)||(year%400==0))
        month[1] = 29 ;

        Hi prafic what is the algorithm that you were using in this?
        And is there any specific method/algorithm that you followed..
        if yes please share the algorithm.

        Hello. I put this program in a simple do{...}While loop. And it is given me a different date when it goes into the loop. Why is that ?

        I'm having the same problem as the person above... This is my code

        do
        {
        strcpy(week[0], "Sunday") ;
        strcpy(week[1], "Monday") ;
        strcpy(week[2], "Tuesday") ;
        strcpy(week[3], "Wednesday") ;
        strcpy(week[4], "Thursday") ;
        strcpy(week[5], "Friday") ;
        strcpy(week[6], "Saturday") ;

        printf ("\nWhen does the customer expect the delivery ? Format:DD/MM/YYYY \n");
        scanf("%d/%d/%d", &date, &mon, &year) ;

        if(((year%100!=0)&&(year%4==0))||(year%400==0))
        {
        flag=1;
        month[1] = 29 ;
        }

        for(t = 0 ; t < mon - 1 ; t++)
        s = s + month[t] ;
        s = s + (date + year + (year / 4) - 2) ;
        s = s % 7 ;

        if(flag==1)
        s=s-1;

        printf("\nThe day entered is %s\n", week[s]);
        if ( week[s] == week[0] || week[s] == week[2] || week[s] == week[4] || week[s] == week[6])

        printf ("\nGreen Aces does not deliver on this day\n");

        }while ( week[s] == week[0] || week[s] == week[2] || week[s] == week[4] || week[s] == week[6]); //As long as it is equal to one of these days it loops

        printf ("\nThis is a delivery day");

        When I put in a test sample it does the loop correctly but the second time around it gives me an incorrect date.
